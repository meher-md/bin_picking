# Camera-to-Robot Frame Transform:
Once you have result_icp.transformation, you get the object pose in the camera’s coordinate system. To plan robot motions, you must know the transformation from the camera frame to the robot’s base frame. This is typically handled by a known calibration transform which can be applied to the result.

# Adjusting Parameters:
. Voxel sizes, distance thresholds, DBSCAN clustering parameters, etc., may need tuning depending on object size and scene conditions.
. Plane segmentation distance thresholds might need refining if the bin floor or walls vary.
# CAD Model Preparation:
Ensure the CAD model is in a compatible format (PLY, STL, OBJ) and that it is properly scaled and oriented.

# Optional:

Multiple viewpoints or merging point clouds from different camera positions could improve results if occlusions are significant.
Additional filtering or fine-tuning can be implemented in each step as needed.
