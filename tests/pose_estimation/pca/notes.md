# Steps to Identify Object Orientation

## 1. Align the CAD Model to the Ground Plane

From the CAD model, determine the object's reference orientation when it is flat on the ground. For example:

- The **primary principal axis** (largest eigenvector) is aligned with the longest dimension of the object.
- The **secondary principal axis** is orthogonal to the primary axis and lies on the ground plane.
- The **tertiary principal axis** points upward (normal to the ground).

Define the ground reference frame:

\[
R_{\text{ref}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{\text{ref}} & y_{\text{ref}} & z_{\text{ref}}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

where \(x_{\text{ref}}\), \(y_{\text{ref}}\), and \(z_{\text{ref}}\) are the principal axes from the CAD model.

## 2. Perform PCA on the Point Cloud

Perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the segmented point cloud to extract its principal axes.

- The **eigenvectors** from PCA represent the principal orientation of the object in the current point cloud.

---

## 3. Compute Rotation from Reference Frame to Point Cloud

The transformation (rotation matrix) from the CAD reference frame to the point cloud can be computed by aligning the principal axes:

\[
R_{\text{align}} = R_{\text{cloud}} \cdot R_{\text{ref}}^{-1}
\]

where:

- \(R_{\text{cloud}}\) is the rotation matrix derived from PCA on the point cloud.
- \(R_{\text{ref}}^{-1}\) (or \(R_{\text{ref}}^T\), since it's orthonormal) is the inverse of the CAD model's ground frame orientation.

## 4. Compute Translation

The centroid of the CAD model (\(C_{\text{ref}}\)) and the centroid of the point cloud (\(C_{\text{cloud}}\)) provide the translation vector:

\[
T = C_{\text{cloud}} - R_{\text{align}} \cdot C_{\text{ref}}
\]

---

## 5. Final Pose

Combine the rotation and translation into a single pose matrix:

\[
T_{\text{final}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
R_{\text{align}} & T \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

---

With these steps, you can compute the full pose (rotation and translation) of an object in 3D space.
